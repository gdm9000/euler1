# Exploring Program Languages

This is a collection of solutions for Project Euler's problem 1 (http://projecteuler.net/problem=1), written in different languages and different paradigms. The problem is:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
